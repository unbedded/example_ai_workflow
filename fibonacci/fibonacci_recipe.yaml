 
target_name: Fibonacci

requirements: |
  - Implement method get(index) 
  - Return Fibonacci number at the specified index.
  - Validate that the index is positive and is an integer.  

architecture: |
  - Encapsulate functionality into class named [TARGET_NAME].
  - thread-safe is not required - single-threaded operation is sufficient.
  - Accept an optional maximum index (max_index) during initialization to limit the range of Fibonacci numbers.
  - Handle edge cases and invalid operations predictably.
  - Use caching to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers for performance optimization.
